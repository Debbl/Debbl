## Summary

&lt;!--
Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem
does the pull request solve?
--&gt;

The parsePluginOptions seemed to be duplicated within
[BabelPlugin.ts](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/f5af92d2c47d1e1f455faf912b1d3221d1038c37/compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/Babel/BabelPlugin.ts#L32)
and
[Program.ts](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/f5af92d2c47d1e1f455faf912b1d3221d1038c37/compiler/packages/babel-plugin-react-compiler/src/Entrypoint/Program.ts#L220).
Since the options already parsed in BabelPlugin.ts should have been
passed to compileProgram, in this PR we deleted parsePluginOptions in
compileProgram and used the options passed as arguments as they are.
I've done that.

## How did you test this change?

&lt;!--

Basically make `console.error` and `console.warn` behave like normal -
when a component stack isn't appended. I need this because I need to be
able to print rich logs with the component stack option and to be able
to disable instrumentation completely in `console.createTask`
environments that don't need it.

Currently we can't print logs with richer objects because they're
toString:ed first. In practice, pretty much all arguments we log are
already toString:ed so it's not necessary anyway. Some might be like a
number. So it would only be a problem if some environment can't handle
proper consoles but then it's up to that environment to toString it
before logging.

The `Warning: ` prefix is historic and is both noisy and confusing. It's
mostly unnecessary since the UI surrounding `console.error` and
`console.warn` tend to have visual treatment around it anyway. However,
it's actively misleading when `console.error` gets prefixed with a
Warning that we consider an error level. There's an argument to be made
that some of our `console.error` don't make the bar for an error but
then the argument is to downgrade each of those to `console.warn` - not
to brand all our actual error logging with `Warning: `.

Apparently something needs to change in React Native before landing this
because it depends on the prefix somehow which probably doesn't make
sense already.</div>

Adds a shape type for component props, which has one defined property: "ref". This means that if the ref property exists, we can type usage of `props.ref` (or via destructuring) the same as the result of `useRef()` and infer downstream usage similarly.

## Overview

The clever trick in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/29799 turns
out to not work because signedsource includes the generated hash in the
header. Reverts back to checking git diff, filtering out the REVISION
file and `@generated` headers.</div>

There are two cases where it's legit/intended to remove scopes, and we can inline the scope rather than reify a "pruned" scope:
* Scopes that contain a single instruction with a hook call. The fact that we create a scope in this case at all is just an artifact of it being simpler to do this and remove the scope later rather than try to avoid creating it in the first place. So for these scopes, we can just inline them.
* Scopes that are provably non-escaping. Removing the scope is an optimization, not a case of us having to prune away something that should be there. So again, its fine to inline in this case.

I found this from syncing the stack internally and looking at differences in compiled output. The latter case was most common but the first case is just an obvious improvement.

Adds additional information to the CompileSuccess LoggerEvent:
* `prunedMemoBlocks` is the number of reactive scopes that were pruned for some reason.
* `prunedMemoValues` is the number of unique _values_ produced by those scopes.

Both numbers exclude blocks that are just a hook call - ie although we create and prune a scope for eg `useState()`, that's just an artifact of the sequencing of our pipeline. So what this metric is counting is cases of _other_ values that go unmemoized. See the new fixture, which takes advantage of improvements in the snap runner to optionally emit the logger events in the .expect.md file if you include the "logger" pragma in a fixture.

Mostly addresses the issue with non-reactive pruned scopes. Before, values from pruned scopes would not be memoized, but could still be depended upon by downstream scopes. However, those downstream scopes would assume the value could never change. This could allow the developer to observe two different versions of a value - the freshly created one (if observed outside a scope) or a cached one (if observed inside, or through) a scope which used the value but didn't depend on it.

The fix here is to consider the outputs of pruned reactive scopes as reactive. Note that this is a partial fix because of things like control variables â€” the full solution would be to mark these values as reactive, and then re-run InferReactivePlaces. We can do this once we've fully converted our pipeline to use HIR everywhere. For now, this should fix most issues in practice because PruneNonReactiveDependencies already does basic alias tracking (see new fixture).

                                        <div class="message">compiler: Promote pruned scope declarations to temporaries if used in a later scope

There's a category of bug currently where pruned reactive scopes whose outputs are non-reactive can have their code end up inlining into another scope, moving the location of the instruction. Any value that had a scope assigned has to have its order of evaluation preserved, despite the fact that it got pruned, so naively we could just force every pruned scope to have its declarations promoted to named variables.

However, that ends up assigning names to _tons_ of scope declarations that don't really need to be promoted. For example, a scope with just a hook call ends up with:

```
const x = useFoo();

=&gt;

scope {
 $t0 = Call read useFoo$ (...);
}
$t1 = StoreLocal 'x' = read $t0;
```

Where t0 doesn't need to be promoted since it's used immediately to assign to another value which is a non-temporary.

So the idea of this PR is that we can track outputs of pruned scopes which are directly referenced from inside a later scope. This fixes one of the two cases of the above pattern. We'll also likely have to consider values from pruned scopes as always reactive, i'll do that in the next PR.

There are a few places where we want to check whether a value actually got memoized, and we currently have to infer this based on values that "should" have a scope and whether a corresponding scope actually exists. This PR adds a new ReactiveStatement variant to model a reactive scope block that was pruned for some reason, and updates all the passes that prune scopes to instead produce this new variant.

## Overview

Reverts https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/26616 and implements the
suggested way instead.

This change in #26616 broken the internal sync command, which now
results in duplicated `@generated` headers. It also makes it harder to
detect changes during the diff train sync. Instead, we will check for
changes, and if there are changes sign the files and commit them to the
sync branch.

## Strategy

The new sync strategy accounts for the generated headers during the
sync:
- **Revert Version**: Revert the version strings
- **Revert @generated**: Re-sign the files (will be the same hash as
before if unchanged)
- **Check**: Check if there are changes **if not, skip**
- **Re-apply Version**: Now add back the new version string
- **Re-sign @generated**: And re-generate the headers

Then commit to branch. This ensures that if there are no changes, we'll
skip.

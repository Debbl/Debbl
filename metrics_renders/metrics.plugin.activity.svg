When the user app has a babel.config file that is missing the compiler,
strange things happen as babel does some strange merging of options from
the user's config and in various callsites like in our eslint rule and
healthcheck script. To minimize odd behavior, we default to not reading

This didn't actually fail before but I'm just adding an extra check.

Currently Client References are always "function" proxies so they never
fall into this branch. However, we do in theory support objects as
client references too depending on environment. We have checks
elsewhere. So this just makes that consistent.</div>

When I added new builtin types for jsx and functions, i forget to add a shape definition. This meant that attempting to accesss a property or method on these types would cause an internal error with an unresolved shape. That wasn't obvious because we rarely call methods on these types.

I confirmed that the new fixtures here fail without the fix.

We currently don't report an error if the code attempts to reassign a const. Our thinking has been that we're not trying to catch all possible mistakes you could make in JavaScript — that's what ESLint, TypeScript, and Flow are for — and that we want to focus on React errors. However, accidentally reassigning a const is easy to catch and doesn't get in the way of other analysis so let's implement it.

Note that React Compiler's ESLint plugin won't report these errors by default, but they will show up in playground.

Fixes the behavior of actions that are queued by useActionState to use
the action function that was current at the time it was dispatched, not
at the time it eventually executes.

The conceptual model is that the action is immediately dispatched, as if
it were sent to a remote server/worker. It's the remote worker that
maintains the queue, not the client.

This is another property of actions makes them more like event handlers
than like reducers.</div>

Throw an error during module initialization if the version of the
"react-dom" package does not match the version of "react".

We used to be more relaxed about this, because the "react" package
changed so infrequently. However, we now have many more features that
rely on an internal protocol between the two packages, including Hooks,
Float, and the compiler runtime. So it's important that both packages
are versioned in lockstep.

Before this change, a version mismatch would often result in a cryptic
internal error with no indication of the root cause.

Instead, we will now compare the versions during module initialization
and immediately throw an error to catch mistakes as early as possible
and provide a clear error message.</div>

Stacked on #29206 and #29221.

This disables appending owner stacks to console when
`console.createTask` is available in the environment. Instead we rely on
native "async" stacks that end up looking like this with source maps and
ignore list enabled.

&lt;img width="673" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-22 at 4 00 27 PM"

Unfortunately Chrome requires a string name for each async stack and,
worse, a suffix of `(async)` is automatically added which is very
confusing since it seems like it might be an async component or
something which it is not.

In this case it's not so bad because it's nice to refer to the host
component which otherwise doesn't have a stack frame since it's
internal. However, if there were more owners here there would also be a
`&lt;Counter&gt; (async)` which ends up being kind of duplicative.

If the Chrome DevTools is not open from the start of the app, then
`console.createTask` is disabled and so you lose the stack for those
errors (or those parents if the devtools is opened later). Unlike our
appended ones that are always added. That's unfortunate and likely to be
a bit of a DX issue but it's also nice that it saves on perf in DEV mode
for those cases. Framework dialogs can still surface the stack since we
also track it in user space in parallel.

This currently doesn't track Server Components yet. We need a more
clever hack for that part in a follow up.

I think I probably need to also add something to React DevTools to
disable its stacks for this case too. Since it looks for stacks in the
console.error and adds a stack otherwise. Since we don't add them
anymore from the runtime, the DevTools adds them instead.</div>

Stacked on #29044.

To work with `console.createTask(...).run(...)` we need to be able to
run a function in the scope of the task.

The main concern with this, other than general performance, is that it
might add more stack frames on very deep stacks that hit the stack
limit. Such as with the commit phase where we recursively go down the
tree. These callbacks aren't really necessary in the recursive part but
only in the shallow invocation of the commit phase for each tag. So we
could refactor the commit phase so that only the shallow part at each
level is covered this way.</div>

This one should be fully behind the `enableOwnerStacks` flag.

Instead of printing the parent Component stack all the way to the root,
this now prints the owner stack of every JSX callsite. It also includes
intermediate callsites between the Component and the JSX call so it has
potentially more frames. Mainly it provides the line number of the JSX
callsite. In terms of the number of components is a subset of the parent
component stack so it's less information in that regard. This is usually
better since it's more focused on components that might affect the
output but if it's contextual based on rendering it's still good to have
parent stack. Therefore, I still use the parent stack when printing DOM
nesting warnings but I plan on switching that format to a diff view
format instead (Next.js already reformats the parent stack like this).

__Follow ups__

- Server Components show up in the owner stack for client logs but logs
done by Server Components don't yet get their owner stack printed as
they're replayed. They're also not yet printed in the server logs of the
RSC server.

- Server Component stack frames are formatted as the server and added to
the end but this might be a different format than the browser. E.g. if
server is running V8 and browser is running JSC or vice versa. Ideally
we can reformat them in terms of the client formatting.

- This doesn't yet update Fizz or DevTools. Those will be follow ups.
Fizz still prints parent stacks in the server side logs. The stacks
added to user space `console.error` calls by DevTools still get the
parent stacks instead.

- It also doesn't yet expose these to user space so there's no way to
get them inside `onCaughtError` for example or inside a custom
`console.error` override.

- In another follow up I'll use `console.createTask` instead and
completely remove these stacks if it's available.</div>
